                Hi everyone my name is Erik, 
                I am a sophomore Software Engineering Student at The University of Texas at Dallas 
                I am passionate about technology, leadership and designing products.  
                My goal is to become a Software Engineer and have meaningful impact solving problems around the world.
            </p>


        <h2> About me </h2>  
            <p> I was born in Dallas, TX, however I spent the majority of my childhood in a small village named "Ojitos" 
                which is located in Zacatecas, Mexico. And while I was there I didn't know anything about Computer Science 
                however, I did play a lot of video games and I dreamed of creating my own one day. 
                When I arrived to the United States I tried different types of classes like, video production, welding and by
                my senior year I decided to major in Software Engineering because I saw it as a way to incorporate problem solving skills
                arts, and other fun things that I liked about my other classes.
